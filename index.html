  <p>Persian cats were the first cat breed to be on display at cat shows. They are the most popular cat breed in the US, this happed after they were brought to the US in 1906 and farmers quite enjoyed their company. Dispite their looks, persians are actually very low maintenance. Their coats also come in all sorts of colors, patterns, and sizes.</p>
